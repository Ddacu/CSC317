        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Daniel Jose Dacumos, I'm a Junior at San Francisco State
        University currently studying to be a Computer Science Major. I have
        had an interest in Computer Science since my time in Middle School. Due to my
        interest in newer technologies from phones to computers I've had an interest in
        creating software and websites through coding. My aspirations are to be a 
        Software Engineer or a Web Developer. In my free time, I prefer to read or watch
        something calming to have clearer mind before working on any tasks might have to
        do.

            <ul>

                <li>
                    <h3>Face Scanner</h3>
                    <p>Using Python I was able to create a program that is able to recognize, 
                    but also match the faces of people in order to identify their identity and 
                    who they are based off facial features.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Face Matching</li>
                        <li>Identification</li>
                        <li>Facial Recognition</li>

                    <h3>Basic Chat Room</h3>
                    <p>Using the Firebase API I was able to use the cloud database to create 
                    a basic chat room. Using it we can store both chat messages and user information 
                    n real time. With people from different regions from the world to be able to 
                    chat with one another.</p>
